This is an introductory guided project on KMeans-Unsupervise from Coursera, created by Professor Ryan Ahmed. Through this project, I gained knowledge on the application of KMeans with Sklearn, Mathplotlib, Numpy, Seaborn, and Pandas. I used these tools to create customer segmentation for marketing purposes.
